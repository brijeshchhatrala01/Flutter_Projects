Q : A) Can class implements more than one interface? B) Can class extends more than one class in dart ?

--> A) Yes. class can be implements more than one interface at once.
       Through this we can achive multiple inheritence.

       //example
       abstract class A2
       {
              void a2();

       }
       abstract class B2
       {
              void b2();

       }

       class MultipleEx implements A2,B2
       {
              void mul()
              {
                     print("Multiple Called");
              }

              void a2()
              {
                     print("a2 called");
              }
              void b2()
              {    
                     print("b2 called");
              }

       }
       void main()
       {
              var m1 = MultipleEx();
              m1.a2();
              m1.b2();
       }

--> B) No class doesn't extends more than one class at once.
       
      -Because of dart doesn't support multiple inheritence this is not to be possible.

      -It gives an error if you try to extends more than one class in dart.
