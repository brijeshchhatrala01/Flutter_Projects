Q : What are the rules of method overriding?

--> The method to be overridden must be written in the subclass, not in the same class.

   -The return type and argument list must be the same as the method in the superclass.

   -The constructor of the superclass cannot be inherited in a subclass.

   -The methods defined in the child and the parent class should be the exact copy, from name to argument list except the content present inside the method.
