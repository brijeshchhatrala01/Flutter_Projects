Q : Can a superclass access subclass member?

--> No superclass doesn't access subclass member.
    But you can access superclass member in subclass.For the method and constructer you can use super keword.
    If you try to access subclass member in superclass than it gives an compiler error.

    //example
    class A {
        var a = 4;
    }
    class B extends A {
        disp() => "Superclass member a : $a"
    }
    main() {
        var ob1 = B();
        print("${ob1.disp()}");
    }
