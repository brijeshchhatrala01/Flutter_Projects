Q : Can a subclass instance method override a superclass static method? 

--> No subclass instance method can't override a superclass static method.
    static method doesn't support overriding.
    static method only called with classname 
    //e.g. 
    class A {
        static greet(String name) => "Hello Dear $name"
    }
    main() {
        A.greet("Brijesh");//static method only called with classname.
    }
